        component: `A static row of exactly 7 \`CalendarButton\` cells representing one calendar week. Handles the \`isPast\` flag to visually de-emphasise past days and highlights the selected day.

## When to use
- When you need a single-week date selector with no horizontal scroll (e.g. a compact week header inside a card)
- As the presentational week row inside \`CalendarModule\` or any other scrollable container you manage externally

## When NOT to use
- Don't use when the user needs to browse beyond a single week — use \`CalendarModule\` instead, which includes pagination and auto-scroll
- Don't use for arbitrary option selection — use \`ChoiceTile\` for non-date choices

## Pairs well with
- \`CalendarModule\` uses its own scroll logic rather than composing CalendarWeek, but CalendarWeek is the right building block when you need a standalone week row
- Week-header patterns inside meal cards or summary widgets

## Tokens used
- Cell gap: \`--spacing-4\`
- All other tokens: inherited from \`CalendarButton\` — see [CalendarButton](?path=/docs/components-calendarbutton--docs) for the full mapping`,
