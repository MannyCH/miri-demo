        component: `Section widget for bulk-importing recipes from a local folder. Pairs \`.txt\` recipe files with same-named image files, shows a progress bar during the import, and summarises successes/failures when done.

## When to use
- On the account or settings page when the user wants to seed their recipe library from a folder of exported files
- Only for power-user / admin-style bulk data entry — not for single-recipe creation

## When NOT to use
- Don't use for importing a single recipe — the standard recipe creation form is more appropriate
- Don't embed inside a list row or card; it is a self-contained section meant to fill a content area

## Pairs well with
- Placed inside an account/settings page beneath the \`AccountCard\`
- Can be preceded by a short explainer paragraph about the expected folder structure (\`.txt\` + matching image filenames)

## Token mapping
| Element | Token |
|---------|-------|
| Card background | \`--color-background-raised\` |
| Card border | \`--color-stroke-weak\` |
| Description text | \`--color-text-strong\` · \`text-body-base-regular\` |
| Status / secondary text | \`--color-text-weak\` · \`text-body-base-regular\` |
| Icon | \`--color-icon-brand\` |
| Progress bar radius | \`--corner-radius-4\` |
| Row gap | \`--spacing-4\`, \`--spacing-8\`, \`--spacing-12\` |`,
      },
