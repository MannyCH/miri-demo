Dedicated bottom sheet for sharing a shopping list and managing its members. Combines share-link actions with an inline members list.

## When to use
- When the user taps the share or "+" invite button on a shopping list
- When the current user needs to view who has access to a list and optionally remove members
- This is the only surface for list sharing — do not build ad-hoc share flows elsewhere

## When NOT to use
- For generic sharing that is not about shopping list membership — use \`ActionSheet\` with share items instead
- When you only need share actions without member management — use a simpler \`ActionSheet\`
- For features unrelated to list membership (e.g. exporting, printing)

## Pairs well with
- \`AvatarRow\` in the shopping list header — tapping it opens this ShareSheet
- \`ListSwitcher\` — the active list being shared comes from the list switcher context

## Behavior (from shopping-list-flow.json)
- Opens from share button or avatar row tap
- "Copy link" copies invite URL to clipboard
- "Share..." triggers native OS share sheet (if available)
- Members list shows initials, name, "(you)" for self
- Non-self members have a remove (✕) button

## Token mapping
| Element | Token |
|---------|-------|
| Backdrop | \`--color-fill-overlay\` |
| Sheet bg | \`--color-background-raised\` |
| Handle | \`--color-stroke-weak\` |
| Title | \`--color-text-strong\` |
| Description | \`--color-text-weak\` |
| Avatar bg | \`--color-fill-brand-weak\` |
| Avatar text | \`--color-text-brand\` |
| Remove hover | \`--color-text-error\` |
